# numberneuralnetwork
neural network that transcribes written digits between 1-9

you will need the newest version of python 3

along with the following libraries:
  matplotlib
  numpy
  pandas
  csv (it may come with python)

if you want to edit the neural network and add more layers or a larger canvas, beware it will kill your ram.
each pixel is a neuron in the neural network, so the larger the canvas the more neurons needed, and the more demanding the program is to run.
